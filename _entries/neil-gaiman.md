So.. Gaiman is a real test in separating the art from the artist. His books are entertaining and have a fresh voice compared to a lot of traditional fantasy. Unfortunately, he's not only treated many women horribly, but you can start to see those themes pop up in his books if you look for them. The stories also tend to be pretty similar to one another. But some are still very good and worth reading.
