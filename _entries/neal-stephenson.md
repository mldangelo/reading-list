Stephenson is a sci fi descendant of William Gibson. His books are often cyberpunk-ish and explore themes around the metaverse, distributed computing, and biological augmentation. He also comes up with some truly wild ideas, like the Drummers (a cult living in a cave that collectively performs large-scale computations through hallucinogenic drugs and endless sex) and cryptocurrency. At their best, Stephenson's books are diligently researched, thought provoking, and funny. Fair warning though, some of these books have abrupt endings.
