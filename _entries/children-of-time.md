You can learn a lot about a work of sci-fi by studying the biography of its authors. Adrian Tchaikovsky is a zoologist, so naturally his work probes the implications of super-intelligent spiders in a universe far in the future.  Across alternating chapters in *Children of Time*, humans cycle through scarcity, class politics, and technological decay, while spiders (in an experiment gone wrong/ right?) evolve from cave tools to astronomy and planet-scale coordination. It’s a terrifying conceit, but the ending is (spoiler alert) quite optimistic.
