This series is a fast read and a ton of fun. One of our partners called it "pure pulp" (in a good way). Think *Gladiator* meets *Hunger Games* in space: this is a violent story about a mistreated, lowly "red" who rises up through the academy ranks to defeat his enemies and lead his arrogant upper-class peers. School battles eventually become real battles for control of the solar system. Romance, murder, betrayal, Marcus Aurelius quotes, and general drama ensue. Believe it or not, it's kind of a young adult book.
